	Bryce to run next week, must have everything dialed in
	Characterize dark counts
		Collect O(100) light-off, atom-off shots for background rate
	For final sequence ensure:
		RF knife at photon recoil momentum DONE
		Nicely regulated power
		WM calibration
		Analog recording correctly DONE
		Lighthouse remote session DONE
		Tweak up atom number
		Tweak up probe beam power 
	Proposed sequence: 
		{10x data, 1x light off, 1x atom off} per wavelength
		Rationale: Nearly doubles signal acquisition rate. Argument is that the background from the atoms (light off) is most strongly correlated with atom number, which changes slowly, so perhaps need not have single-shot calibrations. The atom-off calibration argument is similar; we just want to check once per freq (and with many scans, this will suffice). 
	Code to-do
